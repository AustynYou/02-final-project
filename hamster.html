            Hamsters are small, stocky rodents that can make excellent pets if
            given appropriate care and veterinary treatment. The average hamster
            lifespan is relatively short, around 1-2 years, but they can live up
            to 5 years.

              If your vet instructs you to give your hamster a true
              soap-and-water bath, keep the following tips in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ensure the water temperature is warm enough to not cause
                hypothermia, but it should not be scalding. Test the water on
                your inner wrist or elbow. It should be lukewarm and
                unoffensive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a hamster-friendly shampoo and rinse with warm water but be
                careful not to get any soap in the mouth or eyes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bathe your hamster in a warm room, such as a bathroom, without
                drafts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use an easy-to-clean waterproof container, such as Tupperware,
                that has high sides to avoid your hamster escaping.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            Hamsters use body language much as we do. They can display a range
            of emotions that include being: happy, afraid, threatened, curious,
            startled, angry, and many other emotions. They even use sign
            language to a small extent when conversing with others.

                Hamsters burrow to hide and stay safe when they are asleep. This
                behaviour is common when fresh bedding is put inside their
                cages. If the bedding is deep enough, you'll probably find your
                hamster has created tunnels and covered areas for its food
                stashes. But if it is burrowing and hiding at night when these
                nocturnal creatures are supposed to be awake, it may be a sign
                of stress. This can happen if another pet is constantly watching
                your hamster.

                Hamsters usually grind their teeth when they feel irritated or
                just need some space. It can also be a warning that they are
                about to bite, so it is best to keep your fingers away. Male
                hamsters also chatter to warn other hamsters to stay away from
                their territory. It is considered an aggressive warning, and if
                the advancing hamster does not heed it, a fight is likely to
                break out. If this happens, quickly move one hamster into
                another cage. Wear thick gloves when you separate them to avoid
                getting bitten or scratched.

                Storing food and supplies quickly is a natural instinct for
                hamsters. In the wild, they forage for food and bedding
                material, which they stuff into their cheek pouches to bring
                back to their burrows. Sometimes, they stuff both cheeks, and
                other times, they only store food on one side. Pet hamsters do
                the same - some will hoard and then hide their food stashes in a
                special corner of the cage. Talk about saving for a rainy day!

                Hamsters may quickly empty their cheek pouches if they find
                themselves in danger. In the wild, offloading the excess weight
                means they can make their way to safety much more quickly. Pet
                hamsters might do this when they are startled - for example, if
                someone approaches them suddenly.

                Just as we humans all have our favourite home routines, hamsters
                have their own too. This may be the safest path in the cage. But
                if you have recently made changes to your hammy’s environment,
                it is probably walking along the sides of its cage because it is
                unsure of its surroundings and is familiarising itself with the
                new tunnel or toy you have just added.

            Families have enjoyed keeping hamsters as pets for decades. These
            furry creatures are easily recognized by their stout body, furry
            ears, short tail, and full cheek pouches. Hamsters are playful and
            intelligent, which makes them a popular choice among pet parents.

              <p>
                A Syrian hamster's lifespan is typically 2-3 years. They are a
                larger breed of pet hamster, reaching 6-7 inches in length and
                weighing 90-140 grams. Their larger size can make Syrian
                hamsters ideal for handling by parents and children. They
                typically are friendly to people and will warm up to your family
                with time and gentle contact.

                Like the Syrian hamster, Chinese hamsters should also be housed
                alone and kept as a solo pet. This breed does take a little time
                to warm up to new owners, but once accustomed, they can be
                easily handled.

                region of Russia and is a smaller hamster. It is also known as

                C.W. Campbell, who was one of the first to report this species
                of hamster in Mongolia in 1902. This breed is similar to the
                Winter White Russian Dwarf hamster in that it features a stripe
                that runs down their back, though their stripe is generally
                darker and shorter.

            Hamsters have evolved in a number of areas throughout the world, but
            many spend a significant amount of their lives underground in order
            to evade temperature extremes and predators. They're well-adapted
            for underground life, with short, strong legs and compact bodies.
            Even though there are obvious similarities between the hamster
            species, there are also some strong differences, both in terms of
            history and anatomy.

                Although the Syrian hamster or golden hamster (Mesocricetus
                auratus) was first described scientifically by George Robert
                Waterhouse in 1839

                The entire laboratory and pet populations of Syrian hamsters
                appear to be descendants of a single brother-sister pairing.
                These littermates were captured and imported in 1930 from Aleppo
                in Syria by Israel Aharoni, a zoologist of the University of
                Jerusalem.

                In Jerusalem, researchers were able to successfully breed and
                domesticate hamsters in 1939. Years later, animals of this
                original breeding colony were exported to the United States,
                where Syrian hamsters became a common pet and laboratory animal.
                Comparative studies of domestic and wild Syrian hamsters have
                shown reduced genetic variability in the domestic strain.
                However, the differences in behavioral, chronobiological,
                morphometrical, hematological, and biochemical parameters are
                relatively small and fall into the expected range of interstrain
                variations in other laboratory animals.
