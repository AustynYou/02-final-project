                    <strong>Never take a kitten away from his mother and siblings before he is 8 weeks old.</strong> 
                    <p>
                      The early months are fundamental in starting his life off healthy and naturally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Kittens receive some protection against disease from their mothers through nursing, according to the American Animal Hospital Association. Experts recommend kittens stay with their mothers until they are weaned, which is around 8 weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      They also learn how to socialize with each other by interacting with their mother and littermates. Proper socialization can help prevent behavioral issues down the road. More on that later.

                      Kitten food is specially formulated to provide kittens with the extra nutrients they need to grow into healthy cats. Most experts recommend feeing your kitten specially formulated kitten food until the age of 1.

                    <strong>When raising a kitten, socialization is crucial in providing proper kitten care.</strong>
                    <p>
                      Exposing your kitten to new people, animals and experiences will help build a foundation for a lifetime of positive behavior. A kitten who hasn’t been properly socialized may develop fear aggression and avoid human contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The main socialization period for kittens occurs between 3 and 9 weeks of age, but socialization opportunities should continue to be provided through the first year of life, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. During this time, safely and gradually expose your kitten to people within your household, as well as friends and family members who do not live with you, to other pets and to general life experiences, such as being groomed or going to the vet.

                    <strong>To prevent cats from attacking human hands later in life, teach kittens that hands are not playthings.</strong>
                    <p>
                      “Do not play with the kitten with your hands, allowing him to claw or bite them,” says Jamie Thomas, executive director of Motley Zoo Animal Rescue in Washington. “Kittens learn to play rough, if you allow it, and they will not just grow out of it. You should use only toys to play with your kittens and have a zero-tolerance policy for your kitten putting his mouth on you.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you do allow this behavior, you will have a kitten that bites and scratches—both for fun and out of frustration or anger. If you have a single kitten, he will overuse his mouth and claws because he has not experienced the other side of it since he has no siblings. This bad habit also can cause problems with vet visits as well as introducing children or new people to the pet.

                    <p>
                      Help your new kitten get used to being patted, groomed and picked up. Do not shy away from holding and grooming your kitten, even if he appears skittish. With regular, gentle practice, he will grow comfortable with the handling.

                      However, it’s important to gradually introduce your kitten to new sounds, sights and smells so he will grow to be comfortable around any sensory stimuli, says Pam Johnson-Bennett, owner of Cat Behavior Associates in Nashville, Tennessee.

                      Expose your kitten to different environments, including a variety of floors such as wood, tile and carpet. Your kitten also should be familiarized with a mix of cat toys offering various textures, colors and shapes.

                    <em>“Do not give a new kitten free reign of the entire house right away,”</em>
                    <p>
                      Thomas says. “Kittens are easily overwhelmed, and giving them space stresses them out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “What they actually prefer is a very small world to start, until they adjust, and then you can increase their range,” she continues. “If you give them too much space too soon, they will be stressed, hide and can even develop litter box issues as a result.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Instead, Thomas recommends the “slow release plan.” This means the kitten is stationed in one room where he has everything he needs: food, water, litter box, toys, scratcher, etc. Let your new kitten mingle or wander from the room with supervision, but when you leave or are sleeping, return him to the room and close the door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After a short time—usually a week or two depending on the cat—the kitten can navigate a bit more and know where his “safe place” is, Thomas says. Should he become overwhelmed or stressed over something, he can return to that safe place when on his own as needed. All cats need a safe place where they can go to adjust and feel safe, and where no other animals will intrude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Kittens can be raised to be well-adjusted, kind and sociable pets with the right guidance from knowledgeable owners. Start training as early as possible to project them in a promising direction for years to come.

                Researchers recently discovered that, in the Mesopotamia region and Turkey, and on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, cats were living with among people thousands of years before they existed in Egypt. In fact, evidence suggests that people domesticated cats in the Middle East more than 10,000 years ago, and cats were revered in many of the region’s traditions. Researchers consider the Middle East the place where people first domesticated cats. Additionally, the first evidence of the “blotched“ or “tabby“ coat pattern cat, which commonly appears in domesticated cats, appeared in Turkey during the 14th century.

                The ancient Egyptians began domesticating the African wildcat as early as 4,000 years ago. In ancient Egypt, people believed that cats were magical, divine and godlike. In fact, ancient Egyptians worshipped a feline goddess named Bastet, who was depicted as half-feline, half-woman. Throughout the artifacts from ancient Egypt, cats are a symbolic fixture, illustrating their value, popularity and companionship with humans. Even in death, people immortalized the cats of ancient Egypt as mummies.

                Around 3,000 B.C., the people of China began to domesticate the leopard cat and the western wildcat for pest control. During the Sung Dynasty (960 – 1279), people cherished cats as loyal pets. Artists depicted them in paintings and sculptures. The Chinese culture considered the cat as a symbol of good luck.

              <td>
                During the Middle Ages, many people considered cats demonic and associated them with darkness and witchcraft. As a result, popes and high-ranking officials condemned cats, and the animals were often tortured and killed. In more modern times, especially the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th century, cats began to shed their negative reputation and regained popularity as a loyal pet. Today, cats are one of the most popular and cherished pets in Europe. A recent Boehringer Ingelheim and IPSOS joint study found that over 91 percent of cat owners say their cat has a positive effect on their lives.

              <td>
                Cats arrived in North and South America with European settlers. As the settlers began to cultivate the land, cats helped establish the unique human-animal bond through their natural ability to hunt, drive away rodents and serve as loyal companion pets. Today, the domestic cat is the most popular household pet in the U.S., with nearly 74 million cats living in homes.
