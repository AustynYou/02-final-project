                <h3>What is a Fish</h3>
                <p>
                    Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Approximately 95% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with around 99% of those being teleosts.

                <h3>Take care</h3>
                <h4>What Type of Equipment Does My Fish Need?</h4>
                <p>
                    Food, water, filtration and heat are the basic elements you'll need to provide for your pet fish, but the exact specifications will depend on the type of fish you choose, how big it grows and a number of other factors. Depending on the type of fish you choose, you'll need an aquarium large enough to support the fish's growth, with an air pump and submersible heater. A good rule of thumb for aquarium size is one gallon of water per every inch of full-grown fish. Tropical fish require heating elements in their habitats, but there are some freshwater fish (like goldfish) that prefer cooler temperatures and may not need a heater. It's crucial that you do your research to find out what specific equipment the pet fish you're considering needs.

                        <h4>Provide Enough Space</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the most important aspects of caring for a fish is ensuring it has sufficient space, bigger is better when it comes to fish tanks. A large aquarium not only ensures your fish has ample room to swim, explore and grow, but it is also easier for you to maintain.

                        <h4>Keep the Water Balanced</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is essential that you keep the water in your fish tank within the appropriate pH levels for your fish. If the water becomes too alkaline or too acidic it could be fatal to your fish. Before you go about balancing your fish tank, research the ideal pH level for your fish's species as each breed has different environmental requirements.

                        <h4>Create a Comfortable Environment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Part of the fun of owning a fish is creating a visually appealing aquarium. While it's certainly fun to decorate your fish's home, it also helps improve your fish's quality of life. Fish love to have plants and objects to hide behind and swim through.

                        <h4>Feed Your Fish a Balanced Diet</h4>
                        <p>
                            It's important to learn your fish's dietary requirements. Some fish may need live food, such as shrimp or worms, while others prefer algae or are just fine with generic fish flakes.

                        <h4>Clean the Tank Regularly</h4>
                        <p>
                            Keeping your fish tank clean is a crucial part of caring for a fish. Nobody likes to live in a dirty home â€” not even fish! A dirty tank is ugly to look at and can also be dangerous for your fish. Your cleaning methods will vary depending on the type of fish tank you are using and the items you place inside.On top of cleaning the tank itself, you must also clean the tank's substrate and decorations.

                        <h4>Hiding Fish</h4>
                        <p>
                            Hiding is completely natural behavior for most fish, especially when they are first introduced to their new aquarium. Just make sure you keep your fish comfortable and healthy, and he should start coming out of hiding more readily.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Fighting Fish</h4>
                        <p>
                            If your fish are fighting, it generally means that they are not a compatible fit to be housed in the same aquarium. Many fish are naturally aggressive and will defend their territory to the death. Before stocking your aquarium, you should do research on which types of fish are compatible with others together.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <h4>Fish Swimming Erratically</h4>
                        <p>
                            If your fish is swimming erratically, he could just be playing or exercising. If your fish does it this consistently and seems unhealthy, the cause may be poor water quality. You should test your water for pH, ammonia, and nitrates immediately to see if anything is improper and harming your fish. If everything is in order, the cause of your fish's erratic behavior may could be a parasite. If your fish is rubbing himself up against something in the tank, then swimming quickly away, he may have an external parasite.

                        <h4>Listlessness</h4>
                        <p>
                            If your fish seem tired and lethargic, it can be as a result of many factors. One common cause is improper water temperature. If your fish's water is too hot or too cold, they will be very inactive. Check your heater and verify that your aquarium is at the right level. Other possible causes are overfeeding and improper water quality.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Sitting on the Bottom</h4>
                        <p>
                            If your fish is spending lots of time at the bottom of the tank, it may be normal behavior. Many fish, like catfish, are bottom-feeders and spend their time there. Fish also often sleep at the bottom of their tank. If your fish's activity, however, does not seem to fit either of these reasons, and he looks tired and listless at the bottom of the tank, it may be a sign of disease. If you think this is the case, you should quarantine the fish. A common disease that would cause this behavior is a swim bladder infection, which is a result of a poor diet or water quality. Try fasting your fish for a day or two or feeding it easy-to-digest foods such as peas.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Fish Gasping for Air</h4>
                        <p>
                            If your fish look like they are gasping for air at the top of the aquarium, this is a sign that either your water quality is poor or there is not enough dissolved oxygen in the water. You should test your water and consider getting an aerator for your tank.

                            A cold-water fish, goldfish belong to the carp family. Because they enjoy cool water temperatures, keep goldfish in a separate tank from warm water fish. Avoid keeping goldfish in a bowl, as they can grow quite long and need sufficient swimming room.

                            For ease of maintenance, bettas can't be beat. Also known as Siamese fighting fish, bettas require separation from most other species, which means these brilliantly colored swimmers do well in small fish bowls. While keeping male bettas separate is imperative, some female bettas can live in tanks with other fish. Bettas are a cold-water species.

                            Large, lovely and graceful, angelfish appear in various color patterns. Because of their size when full-grown, angelfish require at least a 55-gallon tank. Angelfish do well with other fish species (although they may eat very small fish) but can fight with each other. Provide plenty of plants in the aquarium, as angelfish like to hide beneath them.

                            Catfish aren't the most spectacular fish in a tank, but they serve an important purpose. These low-maintenance, bottom-dwelling fish consume algae growing in the tank, so they aid in keeping the tank clean. Choose among various catfish species and colors. Most types of catfish are compatible with the fish commonly kept in community tanks

                <p>
                    High quality flaked fish food: What is this fish food made of that makes it a backbone? It depends on the type of food you buy, but most flaked foods are made up of a combination of fish meal, squid meal, shrimp meal, earthworms, spirulina, and vitamins and minerals. This provides your fish with all the nutrients he needs but canâ€™t get in captivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What else can fish eat beyond the flakes? There are many different options from frozen to live food. These are all made especially for your fishy friends and are also species-specific. In fact, these foods are close to what theyâ€™d chow down on in the rivers and seas.

                    <li><span>Dry food</span> It comes in flakes, pellets, and sticks. You can store these for a long while, but buy them in small portions (and only when needed) to keep vitamin and mineral quality high. Flakes and pellets are often low in fiber and can cause constipation, which in turn can cause swim bladder disorders and bloating in fish, so make sure the dry food you choose has a high fiber content or supplement with vegetables.</li>
                    <li><span>Freeze dried</span>Blood worms, krill, and other crawly things are all great treats for carnivorous fish.</li>
                    <li><span>Frozen</span>Just cut off what you need, defrost, then feed. Frozen fish food is high quality, with simple ingredients.</li>
                    <li><span>Fresh</span> Some fish will eat a small bit of pea, zucchini, or shrimp. Your fish's type will determine what is healthiest fresh food for it. We recommend partially cooking veggies, then letting them cool to room temperature before giving your fish a small morsel. You can also chop up shrimp, they're absolutely scrumptious (for you and the fish).</li>
                    <li><span>Live food</span>You might feel a bit squeamish, but it's sometimes part of life, and there are some fish that will only eat live food. If you go this route, avoid purchasing live food of substandard quality, and ask the experts at your local aquarium for suggestions.</li>

            <h3>history between fishes and humans</h3>
            <article>
                <h4>Fish as a pet</h4>
                <p>
                    Archeological evidence of fish-keeping dates back to the Sumerians (2500 BC) and the Babylonians (500 BC). Egyptians considered fish sacred, worshiping the Nile Perch among others. Romans also kept fish in tanks but perhaps not for as decorative purposes as the Chinese; keeping them fresh for the dinner table!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in cave art, being raised as ornamental fish in ponds, and displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings.
                    Up until the 1920s, except for highly developed goldfish and carp keeping in Asia, most fish kept in tanks were captured in the wild. In Florida in the 1920s, entrepreneurs began the first commercial fish breeding businesses.
