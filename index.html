          <h2>What is a Pet?</h2>
          <p>
            A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a
            person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal,
            livestock, or a laboratory animal.

            Pets provide their owners (or "guardians") both physical and
            emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the
            dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction.

              Image result Fish can make good pets but buying a fish should be a
              long term decision as they can live for up to 20 years. Fish need
              regular maintenance to ensure they kept healthy and their
              environment is clean. If you no longer want to keep your fish you
              need to find an alternative home or humanely kill the fish.

              <li>
                <h3>View the adoptable pets</h3>
                <p>
                  View our adoptable animals online. By registering and creating a profile on the adoption site, you can identify criteria you are looking for and sign up for email alerts when an animal matching your needs comes into one of our facilities.
                </p>
              </li> 
              <li>
                <h3>Complete an adoption aplication form</h3>
                <p>
                  Once you find a pet you're interested in, take note of their name, ID number and location in their “About Me” section of their adoption profile and fill out an online application form (no account or password is needed to apply for an animal).
                </p>
              </li> 
              <li>
                <h3>Tak with the staff or volunteers</h3>
                <p>
                  If you are selected a staff member will contact you by telephone to answer any questions you may have about the animal or the adoption process. In some cases a virtual meeting will take place prior to an in-shelter visit to meet the animal.
              </li> 
              <li>
                <h3>Complete the adoption</h3>
                <p>
                  Adoptions are processed with the applicant unless other arrangements have been confirmed with staff. You’ll need to bring government issued photo identification. Check your local BC SPCA branch for current fees and learn what the adoption fee includes.
              </li> 
              <li>
                <h3>Bring your new pet to home</h3>
                <p>
                  Change can be scary for any new pet. Set up your new pet's supplies and make your home safe for them before their arrival so they can have an easier transition.
